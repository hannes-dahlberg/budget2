## Making things right
An important key component of the product is to keep things simple. Importing bank statements and pointing them to different accounts does not necessarily need to be labeled as verifications, transactions and accounts for the front-end user.

A much easier way of phrasing for managing an bank import could be:

*Would you like to put your $11 spendings at Starbucks on the list: "Coffee & Snacks"?*
